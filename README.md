# SQL Project: Data Science Job Analysis

## Overview
This project uses SQL to analyze various aspects of data science job salaries and trends. The analysis addresses multiple real-world business scenarios by querying a database of job salary data. Each query is tailored to provide actionable insights into job markets, salary trends, and organizational needs.

## Objectives
1. Identify countries offering fully remote manager roles with salaries exceeding $90,000 USD.
2. Determine the top 5 countries with the greatest number of large companies hiring freshers.
3. Calculate the percentage of employees enjoying fully remote roles with salaries above $100,000 USD.
4. Identify locations where entry-level average salaries exceed the market average for specific job titles.
5. Find the country offering the maximum average salary for each job title.
6. Pinpoint locations with sustained salary growth over the past three years.
7. Analyze remote work trends by experience level for 2021 vs. 2024.
8. Calculate the average salary increase percentage by experience level and job title between 2023 and 2024.
9. Implement role-based access control to ensure data confidentiality based on experience levels.
10. Guide employees on domain transitions based on input preferences to maximize salaries.
